            <h1>First Day! to Today:)</h1>
            <p>I have a photographic memory of that scene but I'm not skilled enough to put it together in picture still tried something... How's the picture?:p</p>
            <p>It felt unreal when I got to know you were from Karnataka! I remember laughing after asking you "Oh! Kannada barutta?" hahaha</p>
            <p>First few days all I wanted is you to get some nice roomates and friends. I was always busy (I didn't use to go out or party at all after coming here) but once you got settled  you were not able to kill time and we started going out with friends. It was fun!</p>
            <p>We got close eventually, you started sharing all your stories with me (travel stories, love story, college, friends, etc.). The more I got to know about you, the more worried I was coz you trust people easily (which is not bad but not good all the time). All I thought was <i>This girl is pampered and worries too much about small things (I can imagine your reaction while reading this line... hahaha but that's how I was - too much practical, you might call it insensitive)</i></p>
            <p>Here comes the interesting part, you changed me - made me realize I was too much about work and less life... hahaha, I don't know how you got the courage to confront that but I liked that. I realized I can work hard but also shouldn't loose myself in that process. I learned too be patient while teaching others. All this developed trust between us.</p>
            <p>
                <h4>Few things I feel that makes you special:</h4>
                <ul style="padding-left: 20px">
                    <li>I like your dressing sense.</li>
                    <li>I feel you are very innocent when you worry about others problems.</li>
                    <li>I liked how your father treated you from your childhood.</li>
                    <li>You made me understand how girls feel and how they expect to be treated.</li>
                    <li>I like you determination (but direct that energy towards right things)</li>
                </ul>   
            </p>
            <p>We've already talked too much about the day we fought while going to India. I was sorry later for hurting you but I was upset too and I even told myself to mind my own business after we reach Dayton... we didn't speak for few days.</p>
            <p>Later we got along well, i remember us (together) scloding me about that airport scene... hahaha.</p>
            <p>Tenesse trip is where all my mutual friends and I didn't want anybody to be leftout so, i was little rude while ignoring your route suggestions. Sorry again. We sorted it out well... I liked how excited you were about my birthday! Thank you!:)</p>
            <p>The rest is history! hahahaha</p>
            <br>
            <p>Final note:<i> I always like too see you strong. Stay bold my friend!</i> </p>
